# Safety and Ethics

## Safety First Architecture
- **Rule-Based Layer**: A deterministic layer checks for "red flags" (e.g., chest pain, difficulty breathing) before AI processing.
- **Escalation**: Immediate redirection to emergency services or doctor priority list upon red flag detection.

## Human-in-the-Loop
- AI provides **suggestions**, not diagnosis.
- Licensed doctors review all AI-generated pre-consultation reports.

## Data Privacy
- Anonymized data processing where possible.
- Consent collection before AI analysis.
