# Limitations

- **Diagnostic Accuracy**: The AI system is a support tool and may produce incorrect probabilities, especially for rare conditions.
- **Dependency on Input Quality**: Poorly phrased user input or low-quality report images may degrade performance.
- **Scope**: Limited to the diseases present in the knowledge base (e.g., filtered list of common conditions).
- **Regulatory**: Not FDA/CE approved as a medical device; purely for educational/research project demonstration.
