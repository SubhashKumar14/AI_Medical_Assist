MEDICAL LABORATORY REPORT
==========================

Patient ID: DEMO-001
Date: 2026-01-09
Report Type: Complete Blood Count (CBC) + Metabolic Panel

HEMATOLOGY
----------
Hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL (Normal: 13–17)          [LOW]
WBC Count: 12,500 cells/mm3 (Normal: 4,000–11,000)  [HIGH]
Platelets: 85,000 /µL (Normal: 150,000–450,000)    [LOW]
RBC Count: 4.2 million/µL (Normal: 4.5–5.5)        [LOW]
Hematocrit: 32% (Normal: 38–50%)                   [LOW]

METABOLIC PANEL
---------------
Fasting Glucose: 142 mg/dL (Normal: 70–100)   [HIGH]
Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL (Normal: 0.7–1.3)       [HIGH]
BUN: 25 mg/dL (Normal: 7–20)                  [HIGH]
Sodium: 138 mEq/L (Normal: 136–145)           [NORMAL]
Potassium: 4.2 mEq/L (Normal: 3.5–5.0)        [NORMAL]

LIVER FUNCTION
--------------
ALT (SGPT): 65 U/L (Normal: 7–56)             [HIGH]
AST (SGOT): 48 U/L (Normal: 10–40)            [HIGH]
Total Bilirubin: 1.0 mg/dL (Normal: 0.1–1.2)  [NORMAL]

OBSERVATION
-----------
Patient shows low hemoglobin and platelet count suggestive of 
possible infection or bone marrow suppression. Elevated WBC 
indicates active infection. Raised glucose and creatinine 
levels warrant further investigation for metabolic conditions.
